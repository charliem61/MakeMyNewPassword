MAKE MY NEW PASSWORD (Random Password Generator)


Repo Link: https://github.com/charliem61/MakeMyNewPassword

Live Url: https://charliem61.github.io/MakeMyNewPassword/

Goal/Motivation:

    When the user approaches the MakeMyNewPassword app, they are presented with several prompts to in conclusion generate a random password with up to 128 random characters that are pulled from the whole alphabet, all numbers, and almost all symbols used on a standard keyboard.

Problems Solved:

    With multiple prompts asking the user what their preferances are and what they would like specifically in their password, they can create a password with characters, length, and order of random characters that fits their specs desired. 
    
    I feel I met every criteria of what I set out to create.

The Standout:

    Having the option of every number, every letter in the alphabet, and almost every single symbol you have the access to with a standard keyboard. Taking all this data into the console log and randomizing it to generate your new password.

Challenges Faced:

    Being a perfectionist. Getting beyond frustrated when we started in javascipt and my brain shutting down and wanting to drop out which brings me back to my experience with math in highschool. Trying my best to diviate from herediatary/ learned behavior of frustration and walking away from things I cant find an understanding in.
